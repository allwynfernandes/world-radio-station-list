# world-radio-station-list
A (hopefully) exhaustive list of curated radio stations that I enjoy listening to.
My goal here is to create a database of all the radio stations from all around the world.


I find radio to still be one of the best ways to experience and discover new music.
In this world of algorithmically generated perfect playlists where the AI feeds you exactly the kind of music you already listen to, I like how radio surprises you.
Feel free to star, fork, add listings, and submit pull requests!
